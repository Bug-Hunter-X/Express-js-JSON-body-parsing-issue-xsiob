# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with JSON request bodies in Express.js applications. The problem arises when the `Content-Type` header is missing or incorrect, causing the application to fail to parse the JSON data.

## Bug Description

The Express.js application is designed to receive JSON data via a POST request. However, if the client doesn't send the `Content-Type: application/json` header or sends an incorrect header, the request body remains empty (`req.body` is empty). This leads to unexpected behavior and errors.

## Bug Solution

The solution involves handling situations where the `Content-Type` header is missing or incorrect.  The improved code ensures that JSON parsing is attempted even when the header might be absent or invalid, gracefully handling any errors that may occur during the parsing process. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Start the server using `node bug.js`.
4. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/data` with JSON data in the body without setting the `Content-Type` header or with an incorrect header.
5. Observe the console output and the application's response. You'll notice that `req.body` is empty, indicating the parsing failure.
6. Then run `node bugSolution.js` and test again.
